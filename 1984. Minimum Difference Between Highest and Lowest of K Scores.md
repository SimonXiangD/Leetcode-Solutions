# 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores
- Method 1

    Sort and double pointer.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(nlogn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
            sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
            int start = 0, end = k-1;
            int ans = INT_MAX;
            while(end < nums.size()) ans = min(ans, nums[end++] - nums[start++]);
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
