# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
- Method 1

    Use 2 pointers. One is for the middle, another one is for 'extending'. This method is suitable for this solution, unlike method2, it will not waste time calculating some unimportant information, so it performs better while having the same theoretical time complexity as in method 2. (20 ms : 500 ms)

    Also, remember to have 2 loops, as there are 2 types of palindromes.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n^2) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        string longestPalindrome(string s) {
            int n = s.length();
            int maxLen = 0;
            int maxLeft = 0;
            int mid = 0; 
            while(mid < n) {
                int left = mid, right = mid;
                int cur = 1;
                while(--left >= 0 && ++right < n) {
                    if(s[left] == s[right]) cur += 2;
                    else break;
                }
                if(cur > maxLen) {
                    maxLen = cur;
                    maxLeft = left+1;
                }
                mid++;
            }
            mid = 0;
            while(mid < n) {
                int left = mid+1, right = mid;
                int cur = 0;
                while(--left >= 0 && ++right < n) {
                    if(s[left] == s[right]) cur += 2;
                    else break;
                }
                if(cur > maxLen) {
                    maxLen = cur;
                    maxLeft = left+1;
                }
                mid++;
            }        
            return s.substr(maxLeft, maxLen);
        }
    };

    ```

- Method 2

    Use dynamic programming. I personally prefer this method, as it is more general. 
    
    We first understand what dp[i][j] means —— whether nums[i ~ j] is palindromic. Actually, we can make it integar, but in this problem we can use bool to save some memory.

    Then, we give the state transfer formula : 

    ``` h
    if(s[i] == s[j]) dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1];
    else dp[i][j] = false;
    ```

    After this, we decide how to initialize the 2d state vector. We set all to true.

    Then, we decide how to loop over the state. Consider the length of j-i, we use i and len. First we fill all with length 1, then with length 2, ... , all with length n.

    Finally, experiment it on some simple examples or confidently submit it.

    Two pointers is better in this problem, but dp is an important idea that will be used in many further problems.

        string longestPalindrome(string s) {
            int n = s.length();
            int maxLen = -1;
            pair<int, int> ans = {0,0};
            vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, true));
            for(int len = 1; len < n; len++) {
                for(int i = 0; i < n - len; i++) {
                    int j = i + len;
                    if(s[i] == s[j]) dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1];
                    else dp[i][j] = false;
                    if(dp[i][j]) {
                        if(maxLen < j-i+1) {
                            maxLen = j-i+1;
                            ans.first = i;
                            ans.second = j;
                        }
                    } 
                }
            }
            int i = ans.first, j = ans.second;
            return s.substr(i, j-i+1);
        }
    };

    ```
