# 381. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed

- Method 1

  Use hash map.

  The core part is how to gracefully remove.

  First, we know that we need to swap to remove; and we need a hash map to record the index of vals.

  When we swap, we update the index of the swapped val.

  However, there are multiple vals and we need to keep track of the val that we are moving. That is to say, we need to record the place of the val in the hash map. (Or we can use structures like heap instead of vector in the map, but it takes more time)

  This is why we use pair in array. key for val, value for its index in the hash map, and hash map[value] is its index in the array.

  Really tricky!

  Solution:

  ```h

    class RandomizedCollection {
    public:
        vector<pair<int,int>> arr;
        unordered_map<int,vector<int>> umap;
        RandomizedCollection() {

        }
        void show() {
            return;
            cout << "Current map is :" << endl;
            for(auto [key,val] : umap) {
                cout << key << ": ";
                for(auto t : val) cout << t << " ";
                cout << endl;
            }
            cout << "Current arr is :" << endl;
            for(auto t : arr) cout << t.first << " ";
            cout << endl;
        }
        bool insert(int val) {
            umap[val].push_back(arr.size());
            arr.push_back({val, umap[val].size() - 1});
            return umap[val].size() <= 1;
        }

        bool remove(int val) {
            show();
            if(umap[val].size() == 0) return false;
            auto ind = umap[val].back();
            umap[arr.back().first][arr.back().second] = ind;
            swap(arr[arr.size()-1], arr[ind]);
            arr.pop_back();
            umap[val].pop_back();
            show();
            return true;
        }

        int getRandom() {
            return arr[rand() % arr.size()].first;
        }
    };
