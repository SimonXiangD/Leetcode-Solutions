- Method 1

    Dp with memory optimization.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int fib(int n) {
            if(n == 0)return 0;
            int bef = 0, cur = 1;
            while(--n) {
                int tmp = cur;
                cur += bef;
                bef = tmp;
            }
            return cur;
        }
    };

    ```
