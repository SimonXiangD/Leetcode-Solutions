# 60. Permutation Sequence
- Method 1

    The idea is simple, just choose the first, then the second... The only thing to pay attention to is that we need to use a vector to store numbers 1-n and when one of them is added to the string, we need to erase it.

    I don't understand why this problem is hard... It is easier than many middle problems.

    In addition, if we want a range of arrays, like the amount of n/2, then we can use the method in 47. Permutations II, which actually gives all the permutations in the correct order.


    | |   Complexity  |

    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        string getPermutation(int n, int k) {
            vector<int> muls;
            vector<int> numbers;
            muls.push_back(1);
            numbers.push_back(1);
            for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
                muls.push_back(muls.back() * i);
                numbers.push_back(i);
            }
            k--;
            k %= muls.back();

            string ans = "";
            int i = n-1;
            while(i >= 0) {
                // cout << ans << endl;
                if(k == 0) {
                    for(auto t : numbers) {
                        ans.push_back('0' + t);
                    }
                    return ans;
                }
                int tmp = k / muls[i - 1];
                ans.push_back('0' + numbers[tmp]);
                numbers.erase(numbers.begin() + tmp);
                k %= muls[--i];
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```
