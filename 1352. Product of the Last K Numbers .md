# 1352. Product of the Last K Numbers

- Method 1

  Every time we encounter a 0, we just reset the prefix mul array, as in this problem all the information before 0 is no more of any use.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(n)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class ProductOfNumbers {
    public:
        vector<long long> mul = {1};
        ProductOfNumbers() {

        }

        void add(int num) {
            if(num) mul.push_back(num * mul.back());
            else mul = {1};
        }

        int getProduct(int k) {
            if(k >= mul.size()) return 0;
            return int(mul.back() / mul[mul.size() - k - 1]);
        }
    };

    /**
