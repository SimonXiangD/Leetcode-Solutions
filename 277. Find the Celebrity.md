# 277. Find the Celebrity

- Method 1

  We find the current possible candidate, and compare it to next by iterating over 1-n.

  Then we find whether the most possible candidate is really a candidate. Since there can only be one candidate, so using one iteration in the first step will find the possible candidate.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    /* The knows API is defined for you.
        bool knows(int a, int b); */

    class Solution {
    public:
        int findCelebrity(int n) {
            // if 2 people know each other or both do not know each other then false
            // otherwise we can connect these 2 points
            int can = 0;
            for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if(can == i) continue;
                auto t1 = knows(can, i), t2 = knows(i, can);
                if(t1 && t2) continue;;
                if(t1) can = i;
            }
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if(i == can) continue;
                if(knows(can, i) || !knows(i, can)) return -1;
            }
            return can;
        }
    };
