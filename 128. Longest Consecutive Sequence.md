# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence 
- Method 1

    This problem is worth solving again, as it uses the set dst, which is not frequently seen. Set is implemented with rb tree and has order.

    However, this solution actually is not O(n), as find in rb tree takes O(logn). Surprisingly the most voted solution in leetcode is using this method while it is not actually the most suitable answer...

    |             |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(nlogn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
            set<int> s;
            int maxNum = 0;
            for(auto num : nums) {s.insert(num);}
            for(auto num : s) {
                if(s.find(num-1) == s.end()) {
                    int curAll = 1;
                    int curNum = num+1;
                    while(s.find(curNum) != s.end()) {
                        curAll++;
                        curNum++;
                    }
                    maxNum = max(maxNum, curAll);
                }
            }
            return maxNum;
        }
    };

    ```

- Method 2

    This method is really using O(n) time, by storing the maxRange to the boundary point of any consecutive array. I didn't come up with this method, and actually looked up the leetcode solutions and found it. Great idea!

            unordered_map<int, int> umap;
            int maxRange = 0;
            for(auto& num : nums) {
                if(!umap[num]) {
                    int c = 1 + umap[num-1] + umap[num+1];
                    maxRange = max(c, maxRange);
                    umap[num + umap[num+1]] = c;
                    umap[num - umap[num-1]] = c;
                    umap[num] = c;
                }
            }
            return maxRange;
        }
    };

    ```
