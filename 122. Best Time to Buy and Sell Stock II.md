# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
- Method 1

    Interesting problem. We know that with foresight, to gain the most profit, we should let the stocks go down, then right before it goes up we all in. Then we wait until the stock goes to climax, and sell them all just before they go down again.

    Solution:

    ``` h
    class Solution {
    public:
        int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
            int ans = 0;
            int cur = 0; 
            int bef = 0;
            while(cur < prices.size()) {
                while(cur < prices.size() - 1 && prices[cur] >= prices[cur+1]) {cur++;}
                if(cur == prices.size() - 1) return ans; // this case cannot be ignored
                bef = prices[cur];
                while(cur < prices.size() - 1 && prices[cur] <= prices[cur+1]) {cur++;}
                ans += prices[cur] - bef;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };
