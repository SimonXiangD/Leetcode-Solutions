# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

    Use sell and buy array for dp, sell[j] for maximum revenue after selling j objects. We iterate over prices, and for every prices[i] we update sell and buy from 1 to k.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
            vector<int> sell(k+1, 0);
            vector<int> buy(k+1, -prices[0]);
            for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
                for(int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                    sell[j] = max(sell[j], buy[j] + prices[i]);
                    buy[j] = max(buy[j], sell[j-1] - prices[i]);
                }
            }
            return sell.back();
        }
    };
