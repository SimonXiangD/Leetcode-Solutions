# 310. Minimum Height Trees 
- Method 1

    Use algorithm like topological sorting.

    Actually, we store the leaves every time, kill them and then continue to the next layer of leaves until empty.

    The last killed leaves are the answer.

    Really genius idea! Got it from this [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/solutions/76104/c-solution-o-n-time-o-n-space/).

    Space and time complexity should be O(V+E) and O(E), but since the graph is a tree, so O(n).

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
            if(n == 1) return {0};
            vector<int> deg(n);
            vector<vector<int>> g(n);
            for(auto t : edges) {
                auto t0 = t[0], t1 = t[1];
                deg[t0]++;
                deg[t1]++;
                g[t0].push_back(t1);
                g[t1].push_back(t0);
            }
            queue<int> leaves;
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) if(deg[i] == 1) leaves.push(i);
            auto ans = leaves;
            while(leaves.size()) {
                ans = leaves;
                int m = leaves.size();
                for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                    auto cur = leaves.front(); leaves.pop();
                    for(auto t : g[cur]) {
                        deg[t]--;
                        if(deg[t] == 1) {
                            leaves.push(t);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            vector<int> tans;
            while(ans.size()) {
                tans.push_back(ans.front());
                ans.pop();
            }
            return tans;
        }
    };
