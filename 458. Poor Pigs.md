    We view text / die + 1 as dim number, and one pig is a new dimention, dim^needNum >= bucket will be enough.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(1) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
            if(buckets == 1) return 0;
            int dig = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1;
            return int(log(buckets-1) / log(dig)) + 1; 
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
