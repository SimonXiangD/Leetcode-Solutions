# 458. Poor Pigs 
- Method 1

    We view text / die + 1 as dim number, and one pig is a new dimention, dim^needNum >= bucket will be enough.

    I recommend reading Claude Shannon's original paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication. It will explain what is uncertainty H and how H = $- \sum p_ilogp_i $. (directly derived from 3 assumptions: continuity, monotonocity and additiveness, using strict yet concise maths proof). And in this example, $p_i$ is just $\frac{1}{n}$, so H will be just logn. And every pig, during T tests, have T+1 states, so log(T+1). then we divide and get the ceiling to get the minium number of pigs. As for detailed operations, just consider pigs as dimensions and arrange for buckets suffices.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(1) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
        public:
            int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
                double uncertaintyH = log2(buckets);
                double uncertaintyPerPigX = log2(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1);
                return ceil(uncertaintyH / uncertaintyPerPigX);
            }
        };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:
