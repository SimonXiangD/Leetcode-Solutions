# 1535. Find the Winner of an Array Game

- Method 1

  Use curVal and curWin to record the current number and win time. When win time is k we return curVal.

  When win time < k and the whole array is looped then we return the maximum of array, i.e. curVal.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int getWinner(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
            int n = arr.size();
            int curVal = arr[0], curWin = 0;
            for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                int cur = arr[i];
                if(cur < curVal) {
                    curWin++;
                }
                else {
                    curWin = 1;
                    curVal = cur;
                }
                if(curWin >= k) return curVal;
            }
            return curVal;
        }
    };

  ```
