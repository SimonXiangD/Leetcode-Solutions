# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group 
- Method 1

    Solve the problem recursively. The question is how to deal with the middle part. 

    Suppose we want to reverse k elements, starting from left. And we know the before of left. Then we let start = left->next, loop k times to find if there is still k nodes and find end, then we reverse from start to end. The core part of code is as such:

    ``` h

    ListNode* start = before->next;
    ListNode* cur = start;
    for(int i = 0; i < k-1; i++) {
        ListNode* tmp = cur->next;
        cur->next = tmp->next;
        tmp->next = start;
        start = tmp;
    }
    before->next = start;

    ```

    Interestingly, we find that end is not used in the loop. Then why don't we delete end? Well, we have to use end to determine whether we need to do the reverse, as if there is smaller than k number of nodes remaining, we just keep them as they are.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:

        ListNode* reverseK(ListNode* before, int k, ListNode* trueHead) {
            ListNode* head = before->next;
            if(head == nullptr) return trueHead;
            ListNode* start = head, *end = head;
            for(int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
                end = end->next;
                if(!end) return trueHead;
            }
            ListNode *cur = start;
            for(int i = 0; i < k-1; i++) {
                ListNode* tmp = cur->next;
                cur->next = cur->next->next;
                tmp->next = start;
                start = tmp;
            }
            before->next = start;
            return reverseK(cur, k, trueHead);
        }

        ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
            if(k == 1) return head;
            ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
            dummy->next = head;
            return reverseK(dummy, k, dummy)->next;
        }
    };

    ```
