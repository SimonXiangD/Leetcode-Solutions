# 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

- Method 1

  We start from the bottom left or top right.

  Actually, we can also do simple binary search for every row or column, taking time of mlogn or nlogm. If m or n is very large, then this method may be better than m+n time.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(m+n)     |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
            int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
            int i = m-1, j = 0;
            while(i >= 0 && j < n) {
                auto cur = matrix[i][j];
                if(cur == target) return true;
                if(cur < target) j++;
                else i--;
            }
            return false;
        }
    };

  ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    |  Memory     | O(n) |
    |      Time       |  O(n) |


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
