# 45. Jump Game II
- Method 1

    Use greedy algorithm, and let nums[i] be the maximum place that starting from <= i can reach. The transfer formula is: 
    
    $$nums[i] = max(nums[i] + i,\quad nums[i-1])$$

    Actually this algorithm can be optimized a bit, consider cases where we quickly reach the climax (like at <10), but n is larger than 1000, then we can stop changing num[i]. But there is no need to do it, as this is just an leetcode problem.

    After changing nums, we just greedily walk ahead. The edge cases in this problem is a little bit annoying, as the definiton of jump is not that clear.


    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                if(i == 0) continue;
                nums[i] = max(nums[i] + i, nums[i-1]);
            }
            int step = 0, cur = 0;
            while(cur < nums.size()-1) {
                step++;
                cur = nums[cur];
            }
            return step;
        }
    };

    ```
