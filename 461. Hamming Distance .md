# 461. Hamming Distance

- Method 1

  Use bit manipulation.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(logn)    |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
            int ans = 0;
            while(x || y) {
                ans += (x%2) != (y%2);
                x >>= 1; y >>= 1;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

  ```

<!-- - Method 2
