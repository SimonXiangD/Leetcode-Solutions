# 158. Read N Characters Given read4 II - Call Multiple Times

- Method 1

  Quite weird problem.

  We use buf4 to store previously got parameters, and i4 to record where we have gone to, and n4 the valid stored members.

  When reading, if i4 equals n4, then we read4 again and update i4, n4, buf4.

  If i4 is smaller than n4, we iterate until i = n or i4 = n4, and go back to first step.

  Indeed a hard problem...

  And [this link](https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4-ii-call-multiple-times/solutions/49618/simple-short-java-c/) has an elegant solution. I got inspired from it.

  Solution:

  ```h

    /**
    * The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
    *     int read4(char *buf4);
    */

    class Solution {
    public:
        /**
        * @param buf Destination buffer
        * @param n   Number of characters to read
        * @return    The number of actual characters read
        */
        char buf4[4];
        int i4 = 0, n4 = 0;
        int read(char *buf, int n) {
            int i = 0;
            while(i < n) {
                if(i4 == n4) {
                    n4 = read4(buf4);
                    i4 = 0;
                }
                if(n4 == 0) return i;
                while(i < n && i4 < n4) {
                    buf[i++] = buf4[i4++];
                }
            }
            return i;
        }
    };

  ```
