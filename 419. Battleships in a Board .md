# 419. Battleships in a Board

- Method 1

  We judge left and top one of the current ship and add to ans based on this.

  In this way, we can do it in one-pass, O(1) memory and not changing the original matrix.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(mn)      |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
            int ans = 0;
            int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
            for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if(board[i][j] == 'X') {
                        bool add = true;
                        if(i && board[i-1][j] == 'X') add = false;
                        if(j && board[i][j-1] == 'X') add = false;
                        if(add) ans++;
                    }
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

  ```

    | ----------- | ----------- |
    |  Memory     | O(n) |
    |      Time       |  O(n) |
