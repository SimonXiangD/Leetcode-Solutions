# 1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero 
- Method 1

    Just like 2sum.

    However, since all numbers are positive, we can actually solve it using 2 pointers. And this method is even better, which can give result not only equal but also smaller than the target. But I am too lazy to add it. Try it yourself, it is not hard!

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
            unordered_map<int, int> umap;
            umap[0] = -1;
            int cur = 0, n = nums.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                cur += nums[i];
                if(!umap.count(cur)) umap[cur] = i;
            }
            cur = 0;
            int ans = umap.count(x) ? umap[x] + 1 : INT_MAX;
            for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
                cur += nums[i];
                int tar = x - cur;
                if(umap.count(tar) && umap[tar] < i) ans = min(ans, 1 + umap[tar] + n-i);
            }
            return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h
