# 22. Generate Parentheses
- Method 1

    Use dp, dp[n] stands for all combinations of n pairs. Then for n+1, just consider where the ')' lies.

    I made a silly mistake in this problem —— I push_back tmp(fixed) instead of tmp1(which is the desired result changed in the loop). So, be careful when naming similar variables and performing operations on those similar variables.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:

        vector<vector<string>> ans;

        void generateAtN(int n) {
            if(n == 1) {
                ans[1].push_back("()");
                return;
            }
            string tmp = "(";
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if(i == 0) {
                    string tmp1 = tmp + ")";
                    for(auto& str : ans[n - i - 1]) {
                        string tmp2 = tmp1 + str;
                        ans[n].push_back(tmp2);
                    }
                    continue;
                }
                for(auto& str1 : ans[i]) {
                    string tmp1 = tmp + str1 + ")";
                    if(n - i - 1 == 0) ans[n].push_back(tmp1);
                    for(auto& str2 : ans[n - i - 1]) {
                        string tmp2 = tmp1 + str2;
                        ans[n].push_back(tmp2);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
            ans = vector<vector<string>>(n+1);
            for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                generateAtN(i);
            }
            return ans[n];
        }
    };

- Method 2

    This method is very concise. Use left and right to record how many signs remain to be added, and recursively solve the problem. 

    Elegant!

    The memory is also smaller theoretically. However, in reality, as n is small, time and memory actually costs more under this situation, as functions are pushed into stack.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O( $4^{n}n^{-\frac{3}{2}}$) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:

        vector<string> ans;

        void addParentheses(int left, int right, string s) {
            if(!left && !right) ans.push_back(s);
            if(left) addParentheses(left-1, right, s+'(');
            if(right > left) addParentheses(left, right-1, s+')');
        }

        vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
            addParentheses(n,n,"");
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```

- Additional Knowledge:

    How is the weird formula $4^{n}n^{-\frac{3}{2}}$ calculated? 

    Firstly, by analyzing the creating process, we know for n, the time complexity is [Catalan Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number): 

    $$C_n = \frac{1}{2n+1}\binom{2n+1}{n} $$ 
    
    Using [stirling formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation), we can show:
  
    $$O(C_n) = O(4^{n}n^{-\frac{3}{2}}) $$

    Then, we need to calculate the equivalent complexity of 

    $$\sum_{x = 0}^{n} O(C_n),  \quad   i.e. \quad   \sum_{x = 0}^{n} O(4^{n}n^{-\frac{3}{2}})$$

    To be frank, I failed to give a formula to it, as the equivalent [intergral version](https://www.zhihu.com/question/46868161) of it don't have a elementary solution. However, I still found a [answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/903593/sum-of-catalan-numbers) that estimates the upper bound of the sum, which is also $ 4^{n}n^{-\frac{3}{2}} $. Apparently, the lower bound is not smaller than it. As a result, after above analysis, we know that the true complexity is: 

    $$O(4^{n}n^{-\frac{3}{2}}) $$
