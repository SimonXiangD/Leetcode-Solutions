# 92. Reverse Linked List II 
- Method 1

    We first iterate to the left index.

    Then, we use start and cur to record the begin and end of the current reversed m nodes. Then for m+1 node, we let cur->next = m+1 node's next, and m+1 nodes' next is the start.

    Afterwards, we update start and end. We repeat this process until reaching right. 

    Finally, we judge if the reverse starts from 1. If not so, we concatenate the reversed part to the original list at both sides (1 side is defaultly concatenated). Otherwise, we just return the start.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode* reverseBetween(ListNode* head, int left, int right) {
            if(left >= right) return head;
            int ind = 1;
            ListNode* cur = head, *leftPtr = nullptr;
            while(ind < left) {
                leftPtr = cur;
                cur = cur->next;
                ind++;
            }
            ListNode* startPtr = cur;
            while(ind < right) {
                ListNode* tmp = cur->next;
                cur->next = cur->next->next;
                tmp->next = startPtr;
                startPtr = tmp;
                ind++;
            }
            if(leftPtr) leftPtr->next = startPtr;
            else return startPtr;
            return head;
        }
    };

    ```
