# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude
- Method 1

    Prefix sum, so they call it.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
            int maxN = 0, cur = 0;
            for(auto t : gain) {
                cur += t;
                maxN = max(maxN, cur);
            }
            return maxN;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2
