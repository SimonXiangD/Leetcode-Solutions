# 169. Majority Element
- Method 1

    We use a number $maxVal$ to record the current number of most-appearing member sub others. If $maxVal == 0$, then we set the new number as the $maxNum$, and update $maxVal$. ($maxNum$ and $maxVal$ is corrospondent) .

    This problem is tricky, but once we get the idea, it is just an easy problem.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
            int maxVal = 0, maxNum = -1;
            for(auto num : nums) {
                if(maxVal == 0) {
                    maxVal = 1;
                    maxNum = num;
                } 
                else if(num == maxNum) maxVal++;
                else maxVal--;
            }
            return maxNum;
        }
    };

    ```
