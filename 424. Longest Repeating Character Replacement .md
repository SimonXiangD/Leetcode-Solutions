# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

- Method 1

  We know that to get the best result, we only change to one character.

  Then the question becomes finding the longest subarray that contains at most k different numbers, which is just 2-pointers easy problem.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int sub(string& s, int k, char c) {
            // find longest subarray that contains most k chars that are not c
            int ans = 0, num = 0;
            for(int left = 0, right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
                if(s[right] != c) num++;
                while(num > k) {
                    if(s[left++] != c) num--;
                }
                ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
            }
            return ans;
        }
        int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
            // we just replace all to a single char
            int ans = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) ans = max(ans, sub(s, k, 'A' + i));
            return ans;
        }
    };

  ```
