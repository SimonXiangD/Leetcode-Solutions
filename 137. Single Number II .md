#  137. Single Number II
- Method 1

    Every bit will appear 3 times except for the special one, so we add all bits of i from 0 to 31 and divide it by 3.

    The magic solution essentially is this idea, but it actually is just creating some gates and not really general. So I use this solution. ( not a disguise for being too lazy to understand the logical gates in the magical solution... )

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
            int ans = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
                int tmp = 0;
                for(auto t : nums) tmp += (t >> i) & 1;
                tmp %= 3;
                ans |= tmp << i;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
