# 2211. Count Collisions on a Road

- Method 1

  Just judge several cases and keep record of whether there is a fire in the left and number of cars going right.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

  class Solution {
  public:
      int countCollisions(string dir) {
          bool st = false;
          int r = 0;
          int ans = 0;
          for(auto t : dir) {
              if(t == 'S') {
                  st = true;
                  ans += r;
                  r = 0;
              }
              if(t == 'L') {
                  if(r) {
                      ans += r;
                      r = 0;
                      st = true;
                  }
                  if(st) ans++;
              }
              if(t == 'R') {
                  r++;
              }
          }
          return ans;
      }
  };

  ```
