# 2952. Minimum Number of Coins to be Added

- Method 1

  Quite hard problem actually... The philosophy behind.

  We first sort the array, and iterate over. We have a range, every time we update the range. This is quite like greedy method.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minimumAddedCoins(vector<int>& coins, int target) {
            int ans = 0, st = 1, ind = 0;
            sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
            while(st <= target) {
                if(ind >= coins.size()) {
                    st *= 2;
                    ans++;
                }
                else if(st < coins[ind]) {
                    ans++;
                    st *= 2;
                }
                else {
                    st = st + coins[ind];
                    ind++;
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

  ```
