# 55. Jump Game
- Method 1

    Use dp to record the maximum array that ends at i.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) |

- Method 2

    Use the same idea in method 1, but since in the state transfer formula we only need nums[i] and curLen, so we don't actually need a dp array and can save some memory.

    Funnily, the explanations of this problem is almost the same as problem 53, lol


    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
            int curLen = 0;
            for(int i = 0 ; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                curLen = max(i + nums[i], curLen);
                if(curLen >= nums.size()-1) return true;
                if(curLen <= i) return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    };

    ```
