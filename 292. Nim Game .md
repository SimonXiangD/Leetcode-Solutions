- Method 1

  Use mathematical induction.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(1)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool canWinNim(int n) {
            return n%4;
        }
    };

  ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
