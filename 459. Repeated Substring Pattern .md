# 459. Repeated Substring Pattern
- Method 1

    Use kmp. After creating next array, we judge whether n % (n - kmp.back()) == 0.

    How to prove the validness of this solution? Hard to describe in words. You can imagine there are 2 rows that are copies of the original string, and for row1, from n-m - n, they are the same with 1 - m of row2. Then compare between 2 rows, we can actually "align" sub row with length n-m, and judge that the n-m sub row is just the substring.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool repeatedSubstringPattern(string s) {
            int n = s.length();
            vector<int> kmp(n);
            for(int j = 0, i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                while(j && s[j] != s[i]) j = kmp[j-1];
                if(s[i] == s[j]) j++;
                kmp[i] = j;
            }
            return kmp.back() && !(n % (n - kmp.back()));
        }
    };

    ```

- Method 2

    This method is really convenient, but its proof is quite hard. 

    However, someone gives a strict proof of the correctness. Check this [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/solutions/94357/the-math-reasoning-behind-the-most-voted-algorithm/) for detail. Really smart proof.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool repeatedSubstringPattern(string s) {
            return (s + s).substr(1, 2 * s.size() - 2).find(s) != -1;
        }
    };

    ```

- Additional Knowledge:
       
    When dealing with string patterns, kmp is really useful, and its code is very easy, despite the hard idea. 
    
    Spending some time figuring it out is totally worthy, as you may use it to shock interviewers.
