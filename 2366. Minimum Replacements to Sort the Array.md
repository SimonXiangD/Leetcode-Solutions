# 2366. Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array
- Method 1

    Everytime we minimize the valve, iterating from behind.

    The strict math proof is written in my code comment.

    Luck! I am just arriving in 5 minutes and must leave the train, and finished this problem just in time. I am even a bit proud for myself, for only taking 15 min for this problem without having seen similar problems. Maybe my math major is helping me lol...

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        long long minimumReplacement(vector<int>& nums) {
            long long cmax =  INT_MAX;
            long long n = nums.size();
            long long ans = 0;
            for(long long i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
                long long t = nums[i];
                if(cmax >= t) {
                    cmax = t; 
                }
                else {
                    long long curnum = (t + cmax - 1) / cmax - 1;
                    ans += curnum;
                    // t = cmax * a + k, we need to maxmimize k, and 0 < k <= cmax
                    /*

                    if t < 2* cmax, then t/2;
                    if 2 cmax < t < 3 cmax then

                    t = a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + ak ( a1 <= a2 <= ... <= ak)
                    minimize k and maximize a1

                    t = kcmax : a1 = cmax
                    t = kcmax + 1 : 
                    if k+1, cmax - 1 is divided as substraction for k+1 parts
                    if k+i, icmax - 1 is divided as ... for k+i parts

                    minimize ip1-1/k+i !(ip-1) / (k + i) = p - (1++kp) / (k + i) i bigger, maxer, so keep i small as 1.

                    */

                    cmax = t / (curnum + 1);

                }
                // cout << cmax << endl;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```
