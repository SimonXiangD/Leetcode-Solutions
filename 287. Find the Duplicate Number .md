# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

- Method 1

  Really tricky problem... Use Floyd circle method.

  We set slow and fast pointers, when they meet, we start another pointer from 0, and move it at the same speed with the current slow pointer until they meet.

  It's because the uniqueness of the array that we can use such a method.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
            int st = 0;
            int slow = nums[st], fast = nums[slow];
            int bef = slow;
            int time = 0;
            while(slow != fast) {
                time++;
                bef = slow;
                slow = nums[slow];
                fast = nums[nums[fast]];
            }
            while(nums[st] != nums[slow]) {
                st = nums[st];
                slow = nums[slow];
            }
            return nums[st];
        }
    };

  ```

    This is another method.
