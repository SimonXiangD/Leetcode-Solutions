# 743. Network Delay Time 
- Method 1

    Use the famous dijkstras algorithm.

    Every time, we update the closest point, and update all its connected points.

    We find the new closest point that hasn't been reached until all points are reached or we cannot find new point to be reached.

    Then we judge if all are reached and return max time.

    Note: the method can be optimized using heap, and time will be ElogV. But I am too tired to do it today. I have done 10 graph problems today... And also going to intern work at day time and taking school courses at night. Maybe update it when free some time in the future...

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int networkDelayTime(vector<vector<int>>& times, int n, int k) {
            vector<int> reach(n+1, INT_MAX);
            vector<bool> visited(n+1);
            vector<vector<vector<int>>> edges(n+1);
            for(auto time : times) edges[time[0]].push_back({time[1], time[2]});
            int cur = k;
            reach[cur] = 0;
            int minTime;
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                visited[cur] = true;
                for(auto time : edges[cur]) {
                    reach[time[0]] = min(reach[time[0]], reach[cur] + time[1]);
                }
                int minInd = -1;
                minTime = INT_MAX;
                for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                    if(!visited[i] && reach[i] < minTime) {
                        minInd = i;
                        minTime = reach[i];
                    }
                }
                if(minInd == -1 && j != n-1) return -1;
                cur = minInd;
            }
            int ans = 0;
            for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) ans = max(ans, reach[i]);
            return ans;
        }
    };
