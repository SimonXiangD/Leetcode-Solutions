# 2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I

- Method 1

  Use one iteration.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(n)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<string> getWordsInLongestSubsequence(int n, vector<string>& words, vector<int>& groups) {
            int cur = -1;
            vector<string> ans;
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                auto t = groups[i];
                if(t != cur) ans.push_back(words[i]);
                cur = t;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

  ```
