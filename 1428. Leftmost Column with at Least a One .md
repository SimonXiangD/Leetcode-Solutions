# 1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One

- Method 1

  We start iterating from the top right. If current is 0, go down; otherwise go left.

  The correctness can be proved by imagining the plot of the matrix.

  Actually, we can also start from bottom right.

  We can also imagining dropping a ball from top right, and rotate the graph a bit, and think about the movement of the ball.

    * class BinaryMatrix {

        int leftMostColumnWithOne(BinaryMatrix &bm) {
            int m = bm.dimensions()[0], n = bm.dimensions()[1];
            vector<int> cur = {0, n-1};
            while(cur[0] <= m-1 && cur[1] >= 0) {
                if(bm.get(cur[0], cur[1])) ans = min(ans, cur[1]--);
                else cur[0]++;
            }
