# 684. Redundant Connection
- Method 1

    Union find with path compression.

    The idea of union find and path compression is clearly explained in this [passage](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/93647900).

    Although the code is simple, the idea is not as simple. We use recursion in find to update parent of the chain.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(nlogn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> parent;
        int find(int x) {
            if(parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            return parent[x];
        }
        void unionFind(int k1, int k2) {
            parent[find(k1)] = find(k2);
        }
        vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
            parent = vector<int>(edges.size() + 1);
            for(int i = 1 ; i < parent.size(); i++) parent[i] = i;
            vector<int> ans;
            for(auto v : edges) {
                int k1 = v[0], k2 = v[1];
                if(find(k1) == find(k2)) ans = v;
                else unionFind(k1, k2);
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```


- Additional Knowledge:
       
    On solving the problem, I was brought into memory. I was taking dsa last semester, and it is designed for sutdents with completely no coding experience. The first 4 weeks we were taught c++ basics like loop, conditional judgement and some c++ syntaxes, and then we were taught data structure like array, vector(dynamic array) and linked list. 

    Undoubtedly, we had a homework for the first 4 weeks. The last problem of the homework seemed to be a linked list problem, but merely linked list was not enough. Then I thought carefully and designed a data structure but still tle. Then I asked my roommate who had a silver medal in NOI, he told me that the data structure I thought of was called union find disjoint-sets... 

    And the problem indeed should be solved in union find. However, the reason I was still getting TLE was that I didn't add path compression. After adding path compression, I finally passed all the test points.

    Really funny, right? Letting students who were only taught the very basics of programming solve such problems. The knowledge of union find is not hard for me now, however for people who had little exp in coding is really hard. I think this teaching method is to some extent irresponsible and may damage students' confidence, misleading them to consider themselves not suitable for programming. 

    Because this is what really happened to me when I just entered university. The first programming course I took taught important concepts and easy examples at class, and we had to do hard level problems in homework. The final project of the course is to draw plots for functions, we were taught how to write and read bmp file, and an example of a 2d plot. However, we were required to draw 3d plot, without giving any guidance, only hinting us to find a way by ourselves. Off course, now it is just a piece of cake, however I do not think that most students are able to think of using z-index and 4d matrices for perspective projection by themselves. Luckily I had 2 pro teammates who had an amount of exp in coding, and I was given the easier part of the project. Thank them!

    So what's the point of all this talking? I just want you to realize, that, if you are currently finding something hard to learn, or that what your teachers are teaching is hard for you to understand while others seem to deal with it easily, it is not because you are stupid. It is just because you have no exp in what you are learning, and your teacher's teaching style does not suit you. There are only incapable teachers, no incapable students. What you need to do is relax your mindset, and find a tutorial more suitable for beginners. Keep in mind that you are king of yourself, and you are totally able. And I believe there is no such saying as intellect, only education and accumulation, as I got into the best university in China, and saw many people, including IMO math gold medal winner, or student who is going to research theoretical physics as a phd student in mit/harvard. They are not genius, only hard-working and very firm people. They had parents who had great vision, and let them study math/physics/computer science when they were primary school students. So you are not better than other people not because other people are cleverer, but because others started studying much much earlier.

    Never give up, have confidence in yourself, fight for your dream!
