# 856. Score of Parentheses

- Method 1

  Only pairs like () can add to ans, and their val is decided by the number of ( - number of ), so we can use one iteration withou extra space.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int scoreOfParentheses(string s) {
            int ans = 0;
            int depth = 0;
            char prev = '*';
            for(auto c : s) {
                if(c == '(') depth++;
                else {
                    if(prev == '(') ans += pow(2, depth-1);
                    depth--;
                }
                prev = c;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };
