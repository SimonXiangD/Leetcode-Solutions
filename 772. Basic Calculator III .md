# 772. Basic Calculator III

- Method 1

  The core idea is that we use a operator stack and a number stack, with inside priority and outside priority.

  When iterating through the string, we will only meet a number or an operator.

  If we meet the number, the case is simple: we just add the number to the nunmber stack.

  If we meet the operator, we have to check what the previous operator is. For all operators in $+-*/()$ , we denote the current visiting operator as cur, the previous operator as op. Then we can choose several cases to check as example:

  cur = +, op = _ : we have to compute the multiplication first. In this case, we pop the operator stack whose top number is _, and we pop the top 2 numbers of stack and calculate their mul, and add the result back to the stack.

  cur = _, op = + : since multiplication is more "superior", the addition computation should be done after mul, so we push the _ into operator stack and continue.

  cur = _, op = _ : if they are the same _, we should first calculate the previous _, pop stack and do calculation.

  Similar cases can be dealt with for operator $+-*/$ just like above. We also happily discover that the priority of operators have an order, and we can give them a priority number for convenience when doing comparison. So, for cur, the weight for $+-*/$ is 10 10 20 20. (I use 10, 20 instead of 1, 2 just casually, you can also use any number you like as their relative order is preserved, like 1 2 3 4, 6 5 6.1 6.1, ...), for op, the weight for $+-*/$ is 15 15 25 25 (since for cases like 1 + 2 + 3, we should calculate 1+2 first, then 3 + 3).

  If there are no brackets, then we are already done. However, how can we deal with the brackets? We can try to find some examples.

  (1+2) \* 3 : we need to calculate 1+2 before mul 3, instead of doing 1 + 6 when there are no brackets.

  So we can actually see them also as a type of operator, with different priority.

  When ( is the current operator, any previous operator should be put aside, that is to say, ( has a great priority when it comes in. So we give it 100.

  When ) is the current operator, we should do all the previous calculation until the previous operator is (, like the + in 1 _ 1 _ 1 + 1. So its priority should be really low, we just give it 1.

  When ( is the previous operator, any other operator should be prior to it except ), for the former one the case is like + and \*; for the latter one, we have already done all the calculation in above, so we just pop it and proceed to the next operator or number ( so that ) is gone, together with it ). So we give it a low priority 1.

  When ) is the previous operator... There is no such case. So we don't have to give it any weight. We can set it to any number.

  So the logic is done.

  There are some details to pay attention to:

  1. To deal with negative numbers, we just add a 0 before - when the char before - is not ) or number.
  2. We add '#' to the end of array, and '#" into stack at first so that we can determine end by '#" instead of doing disgusting judgements of whether stack is empty and string is iterated over.

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int bin(int a, int b, char op) {
            if(op == '+') return a + b;
            if(op == '-') return a - b;
            if(op == '*') return a * b;
            if(op == '/') return a / b;
            return 0;
        }
        void cal(stack<int>& nums, char op) {
            int c1 = nums.top(); nums.pop();
            int c2 = nums.top(); nums.pop();
            nums.push(bin(c2, c1, op));
        }
        bool isDigit(char a) {
            return a - '0' >= 0 && a - '9' <= 0;
        }
        int calculate(string s) {
            string st;

            for(auto t : s) {
                if(t == '-' && !isDigit(befc) && befc != ')') st += '0';
                st += t;

            int i = 0;
            char op = opers.top();
            while(cur != '#' || op != '#') {
                // cout << cur << " " << op << endl;
                if(isDigit(cur)) {
                    int left = i;
                    while(isDigit(s[i])) i++;
                    nums.push(stoi(s.substr(left, i - left)));
                    cur = s[i];
                }
                else {
                    int inWt = inw[umap[op]], outWt = ouw[umap[cur]];
                    if(inWt < outWt) {
                        opers.push(cur);
                        cur = s[++i];
                    }
                    else if(inWt > outWt) {
                        opers.pop();
                        cal(nums, op);
                    }
