# 238. Product of Array Except Self
- Method 1

    Since we cannot use divide, then we need to store the results of first i muls / last i muls into 2 arrays. This is like the idea of dp!

    Actually, the following solution can be optimized, but only in constant. So I'm too lazy to optimize it, since the idea is more important rather than boring non-essential optimization.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
            int n = nums.size();
            vector<int> frontMul(n+1);
            vector<int> backMul(n+1);
            frontMul[0] = 1;
            backMul[n] = 1;
            for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                frontMul[i] = nums[i-1] * frontMul[i-1];
                backMul[n-i] = backMul[n-i+1] * nums[n-i];
            }
            vector<int> ans(n);
            for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                ans[i-1] = frontMul[i-1] * backMul[i];
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```
