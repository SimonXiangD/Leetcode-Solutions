# 69. Sqrt(x)
- Method 1

    Use newton method. Draw the function, compute the intersection of the cut line and x axis, and judge the ending condition.

    However I don't know how to compute the time... I know in this case the method is quadratically convergent, however changing the math term to time complexity takes some time, but I currently am at a company meeting and don't want to think about it now. So I will just guess that it takes O(logn). Since n is only int, actually making it O(1) also seems okay.

    Maybe I will prove it or give the correct time when I have free time, but now I have to write a document...

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  maybe O(logn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int mySqrt(int n) {
            long long x = n;
            while(x * x > n) {
                x = (x + n / x) / 2; 
            }
            return int(x);
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
