# 1529. Minimum Suffix Flips 
- Method 1

    If there is 0 from behind whose before member is 1, we flip it and flip the 000 to 111 again.

    Finally we flip the whole array.

    And if the string ends with 0, we flip one less time.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minFlips(string target) {
            // 1111
            int n = target.length();
            bool all0 = true;
            for(auto t : target) if(t == '1') all0 = false;
            if(all0) return 0;
            int time = 0;
            bool end0 = target[n-1] == '0';
            for(int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
                if(target[i] == '1' && target[i+1] != '1') time++;
            }
            return 2*time+1 - end0;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
