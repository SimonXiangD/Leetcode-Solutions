# 2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score   
- Method 1

    Use the inversion idea. Divide by 2 as long as we can.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(logn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minMoves(int target, int maxDoubles) {
            int ans = 0;
            while(target > 1 && maxDoubles) {
                if(target %2 == 1) {
                    target -= 1;
                }
                else {
                    maxDoubles--;
                    target /= 2;
                }
                ans++;
            }
            return ans + target - 1;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
