# 621. Task Scheduler

- Method 1

  Use a heap.

  Every time, we find the char appearing most times, and arrange it at first. Then, what we are trying to do is actually put the remaining chars into the saved blanks, so that the maximum appearing time of all the remaining chars becomes smaller every time.

  For example, like aaabbb, n = 2, then the index number heap is {3,3}

  We first arrange a, like:

  a - - a - - a - -

  Now spare is 6, ans is 9.

  And we pop the heap, so heap is {3}.

  We start looping, and 3 = 3, so even if it can be filled in all the blanks, the last bar will be filled 1 time. So we make remain minus 1.

  Then we pop 3 and add 2, with spare - 1.

  Now becomes

  a b - a - - a - -

  With heap {2}.

  We can add the remaining 2 b into the empty blanks, and finally we get

  a b - a b - a b -.

  So now we have filled in all the chars with remaining 1 and spare 3, so ans - min(remain, spare) = 9 - 1 = 8.

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int interval;
        int ans;
        struct cmp {
            bool operator() (int a, int b) {
                return a < b;
            }
        };
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, cmp> heap;
        void run() {
            if(!heap.size()) return;
            auto t = heap.top(); heap.pop();
            ans += t * (interval + 1);
            int spare = t * interval;
            int remainLen = interval;
            while(heap.size() && spare) {
                auto curMax = heap.top();
                spare -= curMax;
                if(heap.top() == t) remainLen--;
                heap.pop();
                if(spare < 0) {
                    heap.push(-spare);
                    spare = 0;
                }
                if(heap.size()) {
                    int addback = heap.top() - 1;
                    if(addback) {
                        spare += addback;
                        heap.push(addback);
                    }

                }
            }
            // cout << ans << endl;

            if(heap.size()) run();
            else ans -= min(remainLen, spare);
        }
        int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
            interval = n;
            unordered_map<char, int> umap;
            for(auto t : tasks) umap[t]++;
            for(auto& [key, val] : umap) heap.push(val);
            // for(auto& [key, val] : umap) cout << key << " " << val << endl;
            run();
            return ans;
        }
    };
