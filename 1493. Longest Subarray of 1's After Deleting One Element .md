# 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element
- Method 1

    The downgraded version of problem 1004.

    Interestingly,  if I hadn't finished problem 1004, I cannot quickly think of a good solution to it. With second thought, I still think it should be done with the method of 2 pointers.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
            int left = 0, right = 0;
            int cur0 = 0, ans = 0;
            while(right < nums.size()) {
                cur0 += nums[right] == 0;
                if(cur0 >= 2) {
                    cur0--;
                    while(left <= right && nums[left] == 1) left++;
                    left++;
                }
                right++;
                ans = max(ans, right - left);
            }
            return ans - 1;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
