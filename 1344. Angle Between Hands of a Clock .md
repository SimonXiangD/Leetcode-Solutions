# 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock

- Method 1

  Boring time-conversion problem.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(1)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
            if(hour == 12) hour = 0;
            double posMin = 360 * minutes / 60.0;
            double posHour = 360 * hour / 12.0 + minutes / 60.0 * 30;
            // cout << posMin << " " << posHour << endl;
            return min(abs(posMin - posHour), abs(360 - abs(posMin - posHour)));
        }
    };

  ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    |  Memory     | O(n) |
    |      Time       |  O(n) |


    Solution:

    ``` h
