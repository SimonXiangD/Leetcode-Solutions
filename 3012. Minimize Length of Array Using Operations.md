# 3012. Minimize Length of Array Using Operations  
- Method 1

    Quite interesting one... If we can find or create a unique small one, then 1; otherwise just count the number of smallest number and do division. 

    A more detailed explanation can be found inside the code comment.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minimumArrayLength(vector<int>& nums) {
            /*
                Every time we choose a and b, a%b and b%a, which to save? suppose a < b
                if save a, then remain a; if save b, then remain b%a
                
                We always hope to keep same number as small as possible. If no same, then only 1;
                
                That is to say, we can always delete numbers that have numbers smaller than them;
                
                if the smallest number only appears once, like x, asdfasdfasfasdfsadf, then we only save x.
                
                So we only have to consider when it appears multiple times, like x, x, x, ...
                
                If there is any number b s.t. b%x != 0, then the problem is quite simple - we just do that, and we have a unique smallest number.
                
                So assume now we have x,x,x, ... ,x,  k1x, k2x, ... knx
                
                Since kix % x = 0, if we save kix, then x->0; if we save x, then x->x, at least better then former.
                
                For x, x, x, every time we kill 2 x and get 1 0.
            */
            
            int n = nums.size();
            int mv = INT_MAX;
            for(auto t : nums) mv = min(t, mv);
            int time = 0;
            for(auto t : nums) if(mv == t) time++;
            if(time == 1) return 1;
            for(auto t : nums) {
                if(t%mv != 0) return 1;
            }
            // cout << time << endl;
            return (time + 1)/2;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
