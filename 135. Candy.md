# 135. Candy 
- Method 1

    We can divide the array into subArrays that has the shape of 'V'. First go down, then go above, so we can give the smallest rating 1 candy, then the left half 2, 3, ... , max(last V right height, cur V left height), the right 2, 3, ... , cur V right height - 1, then let the last number of V become the starting point of next V.

    A special case is when rating are the same coninuously. Then we just give those not in the edge 1. So, in a V there are 3 loops :

    1. Go down

    2. The same

    3. Go above

    In concrete implementation, we just use 2 pointers.

    And there are many details in this problem, like the duplicate of 1 in every V so we will reduce it, when the array reaches the end, when we keep track of the last V right height, when to reset left and right. But the whole idea behind the problem is really simple.

            while(true) {
                while(right < ratings.size() - 1 && ratings[right] > ratings[right+1]) {

                    ans += right - left;
                    // all the cout in this solution is used for debug by me
                    // cout << ans << " "; 
                }
                ans += max(curMax, right-left+1);
                curMax = 1;
                ans -= 1;
                // cout<< " minus 1!" << " ";
                while(right <  ratings.size() - 1 && ratings[right] == ratings[right+1]) {
                    right++;
                    ans += 1;

                    curMax++;
                    right++;
                    ans += right - left;

                        ans += right+1-left;
                        return ans;

                    else {
