# 42. Trapping Rain Water 
- Method 1

    We use left and right, 2 pointers. Use such algorithm:

    1. init of left : the first non-zero element in h

    2. We add right until there is h[right] >= h[left].

    3. Then we calculate all the water in (left, right).

    4. After this, we set left to right, and repeat the process.

    However, there may be such a problem: the left is the biggest in [left, end]. To deal with it is simple, we just reverse the array from left to end, and start from left just like above. So we firstly find the maximum element, and separately calculate the two parts before and after it.

    Actually, we can manually write a different version so that there is no reversion which takes time. But this improvement is only in constant and not really meaningful.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:

        int calculateWater(vector<int>& h, int left, int right) {
            int minH = min(h[left], h[right]), ans = 0;
            int i = left + 1;
            while(i < right) {
                ans += minH - h[i++];
            }
            return ans;
        }

        int calculateWaterAll(vector<int>& h, int start, int end) {
            while(start < end && !h[start]) {start++;}
            while(start < end && !h[end]) {end--;} // actually not used 
            int left = start, right = left;
            int ans = 0;
            while(right < end) {
                while(right < end && (right == left || h[right] < h[left])) {right++;}
                ans += calculateWater(h, left, right);
                left = right;
            }
            return ans;
        }

        int trap(vector<int>& h) {

            int maxVal = -1, maxInd = -1;
            for(int i = 0; i < h.size(); i++) {
                if(h[i] > maxVal) {
                    maxInd = i;
                    maxVal = h[i];
                }
            }
            int ans = 0;
            ans += calculateWaterAll(h, 0, maxInd);
            reverse(h.begin() + maxInd, h.end());
            ans += calculateWaterAll(h, maxInd, h.size()-1);
            return ans;

        }
    };

    ```
