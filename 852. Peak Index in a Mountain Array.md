# 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array 
- Method 1

    Use a binary search. 
    
    Always foward to the higher direction!!!

    Also pay attention to cases when hi - lo = 1, and lo=0, as mid will become 0. Only a simple edge case.

    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(logn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr) {
            int lo = 0, hi = arr.size() - 1;
            int mid;
            while(lo < hi) {
                if(hi - lo == 1) {
                    if(lo == 0) return hi;
                }
                mid = (hi + lo) / 2;
                if(arr[mid] > arr[mid-1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]) return mid;
                if(arr[mid] < arr[mid-1]) hi = mid-1;
                else lo = mid+1;
            }
            return lo;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
