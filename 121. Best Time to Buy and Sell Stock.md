# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Method 1

    This problem is quite interesting. Off course we want a O(n) method, but using two pointers seems not working?

    Actually, the logic is simple but uncommon. If we want to sell at a day to gain maximal profit, we just need to know the smallest price in the days before, and this can be done inside the loop every time when we move forward a day. Then we sub them, compare them to the max.

    The lesson is: sometimes maybe we should let thoughts determine which methods we use, rather than let methods confine out thoughts to a narrow scope.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h
    class Solution {
    public:
        int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
            int curMin = INT_MAX, curMax = INT_MIN;
            for(auto t:prices) {
                curMin = min(curMin, t);
                curMax = max(curMax, t - curMin);
            }
            return curMax;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
