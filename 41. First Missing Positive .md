# 41. First Missing Positive

- Method 1

  We swap val i to index i-1 in the array.

  The question is to avoid endless loop. We only start looping when index i-1 is not i and val is inside range[1,n]. So, as every swap we will move 1 to a correct space, and every correct space, will be changed for at most once. So time is O(n).

  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(n)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
            int n = nums.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                while(nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i]) {
                    swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]);
                }
            }
            int ans = n+1;
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if(nums[i] != i+1) return i+1;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

  ```
