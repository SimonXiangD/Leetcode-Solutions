    Just reverse the array 3 times!

    And remember to mod the k. I really think this setting is stupid, only forcing people to resubmit again.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
            k %= nums.size();
            reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
            reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
            reverse(nums.begin()+k, nums.end());
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
