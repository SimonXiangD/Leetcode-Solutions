# 148. Sort List
- Method 1

    Use bubble sort. Actually I just found out that bubble sort has the advantage of only changing local adjacent information during the sorting process... Originally I considered bubble sort useless.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1)  | 
    |      Time       |  O(n^2) | 


- Method 2

    Create an array, copy the linked list to it and sort it, then copy it to the linked list.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n)  | 
    |      Time       |  O(nlogn) | 

- Method 3

    Use merge sort. To get the middle of a linked list, we can use slow and fast pointer. Just remember that slow = head, fast = head->next ,while(fast && fast->next). Then we divide the linked list into 2 sublists, sort them and then merge them.

    The idea is : Divide and Conquer!

    There are also a few details to notice.

    <ol>
        <li> Using delete is slow. I discoverd this as my code beats only 5%, while I have the same time complexity as others. Deleting the delete speeds up.</li>
        <li> When comparing between properties of linked list nodes, be sure to compare between values rather than pointers. The funny thing is that when I am comparing between pointer->next and there is completely no error or warning message on the leetcode online platform, while IDE like vs actually has warnings. Be cautious!
