# 49. Group Anagrams 
- Method 1

    The key is how to give a unique hash id to every string, so that string with same letters can be put into same group. We just use sort string which is easily written.

    There is another solution where we can just make a function for creating hash code for str using prime numbers. However, when the string is small sorting don't take much time, when it is big the function takes time too. I think the contanst coefficient may even be larger than logm, so I didn't use it as another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(mn) | 
    |      Time       |  O(mn logm) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
            vector<vector<string>> ans;
            unordered_map<string, vector<string>> umap;
            for(auto& str : strs) {
                string cpy = str;
                sort(str.begin(), str.end());
                umap[str].push_back(cpy);
            }
            for(auto& [key, value] : umap) {
                ans.push_back(value);
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```
