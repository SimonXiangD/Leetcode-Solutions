# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

- Method 1

  Use double pointers, but we iterate from 1 - 26 that serve as the character type limit of the current pointers' interval.

  Who would think of such an idea? I think this is quite amzing.

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int longestSubstring(string s, int k) {
            int ans = 0, n = s.length();
            for(int i = 1; i <= 26; i++) {
                vector<int> cnt(26);
                int start = 0, end = 0, letterType = 0;
                while(end < n) {
                    if(cnt[s[end++]-'a']++ == 0) letterType++;
                    if(letterType > i) {
                        while(cnt[s[start++]-'a']-- != 1) {};
                        letterType--;
                    }
                    bool valid = true;
                    for(auto t : cnt) if(t > 0 && t < k) valid = false;
                    if(valid) ans = max(ans, end - start);
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

  ```
