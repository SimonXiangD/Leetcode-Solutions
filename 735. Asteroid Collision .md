# 735. Asteroid Collision
- Method 1

    The most shitass stupid fucking idiot dick problem I've ever met in leetcode. The description is a piece of shit and asteroids moving like balls on a straight line is also crap shit. The guy who proposes this fucking problem must have missed his or her primary school geography class so that he or she is stupid enougth to come up with such an idiot idea to emulate the stack problem with fucking ball-like asteroids.

    Using a stack suffices.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& asteroids) {
            vector<int> stk;
            for(auto t : asteroids) {
                if(stk.empty()) stk.push_back(t);
                else {
                    if(t > 0) stk.push_back(t);
                    else {
                        while(!stk.empty() && stk.back() > 0 && -t > stk.back()) stk.pop_back();
                        if(!stk.empty() && t + stk.back() == 0) stk.pop_back();
                        else if(stk.empty() || stk.back() < 0) stk.push_back(t);
                    }
                }
            }
            return stk;
        }
    };

    ```
