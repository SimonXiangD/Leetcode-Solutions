# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II 
- Method 1

    Use 2 pointers. If curRight has same value with its next, we skip it and all consecutive nodes that share the same value with it .

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
            ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0), *curLeft = dummy, *curRight = head;
            while(curRight) {
                if(!curRight->next || curRight->next->val != curRight->val) {
                    curLeft->next = curRight;
                    curLeft = curLeft->next;
                }
                else {
                    while(curRight->next && curRight->val == curRight->next->val) {curRight = curRight->next;}
                }
                curRight = curRight->next;
            }
            if(curLeft) curLeft->next = nullptr;
            return dummy->next;
        }
    };

    ```
