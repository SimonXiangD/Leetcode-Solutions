# 696. Count Binary Substrings

- Method 1

  We count the frequency of current grouped char and add based on whether the current can form a valid stirng.

  Note: if we don't require the condition of group, then we just need to use a hash map.

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int countBinarySubstrings(string s) {
            char bef = '*';
            int befnum = 0, curnum = 0;
            int ans = 0;
            for(auto t : s) {
                if(t != bef) {
                    befnum = curnum;
                    curnum = 0;
                }
                curnum++;
                bef = t;
                if(curnum <= befnum) ans++;
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };
