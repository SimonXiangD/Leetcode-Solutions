# 218. The Skyline Problem
- Method 1

    We first identify points that can be endpoints: the left and right of building. Then we add them all to a array and sort.

    After this, we need to find the highest building for every point and record it as ans. If the height equals the previous adjacent point, then it can be deleted. 

    To find height, we can just do iteration to find. To improve speed, we use a heap to record the building that may contain current point, and heap top is the highest height. We pop until heap top contain current points and add ans.

    Every interval comes in and out of heap only once, and query time is also 2n, so time is nlogn.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(nlogn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        struct cmp {
            bool operator() (vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
                return a[2] < b[2];
            }
        };
        vector<vector<int>> getSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& buildings) {
            vector<int> points;
            vector<vector<int>> ans;
            for(auto& b : buildings) {
                points.push_back(b[0]);
                points.push_back(b[1]);
            }
            sort(points.begin(), points.end());
            sort(buildings.begin(), buildings.end());
            priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, cmp> heap;
            for(int left = 0, right = 0; right < points.size(); right++) {
                auto t = points[right];
                while(left < buildings.size() && buildings[left][0] <= t ) {
                    heap.push(buildings[left++]);
                }
                while(heap.size() && heap.top()[1] <= t) heap.pop();
                int h = heap.size() ? heap.top()[2] : 0;
                if(!ans.size() || ans.back()[1] != h) {
                    ans.push_back({t, h});
                }
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h
