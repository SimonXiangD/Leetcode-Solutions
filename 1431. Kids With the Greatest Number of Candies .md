    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
            int maxN = -1;
            vector<bool> ans;
            for(auto t : candies) maxN = max(maxN, t);
            maxN -= extraCandies;
            for(auto t : candies) ans.push_back(maxN <= t);
            return ans; 
        }
    };
