# 1845. Seat Reservation Manager  
- Method 1

    Use a heap and we record the biggest seat ever added, use heap to store unreserved seats.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(1 logn logn) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class SeatManager {
    public:
        struct cmp {
            bool operator() (int a, int b) {
                return a > b;
            }
        };
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, cmp> heap;
        int n;
        int used;
        SeatManager(int n) {
            this->n = n;
            heap.push(1);
            used = 1;
        }
        
        int reserve() {
            if(heap.size() == 0) {
                used++;
                return used;
            }
            auto t = heap.top(); heap.pop();
            return t;
        }
        
        void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
            heap.push(seatNumber);
        }
    };

    /**
    * Your SeatManager object will be instantiated and called as such:
    * SeatManager* obj = new SeatManager(n);
    * int param_1 = obj->reserve();
    * obj->unreserve(seatNumber);
    */

    ```
