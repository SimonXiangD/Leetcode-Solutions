    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool overlap(long long a1, long long a2, long long b1, long long b2) {
            return (a1 - a2) * (b1 - b2) < 0;
        }
        bool isRectangleOverlap(vector<int>& rec1, vector<int>& rec2) {
            return overlap(rec1[0], rec2[2], rec1[2], rec2[0]) && overlap(rec1[1], rec2[3], rec1[3], rec2[1]);
        }
    };

    ```
