# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately 
- Method 1

    Just use 2 pointers.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(max(m, n)) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
            string ans;
            int left = 0, right = 0;
            while(left < word1.length() || right < word2.length()) {
                if(left < word1.length()) ans += word1[left++];
                if(right < word2.length()) ans += word2[right++];
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
