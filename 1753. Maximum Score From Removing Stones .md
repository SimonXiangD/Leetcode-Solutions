- Method 1

  Just like playing with valid triangles.

  |        | Complexity |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  | Memory | O(1)       |
  | Time   | O(1)       |

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
            int all = a + b + c;
            return (all - max({0, a-b-c, b-a-c, c-a-b}))/2;
        }
    };

  ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    |  Memory     | O(n) |
