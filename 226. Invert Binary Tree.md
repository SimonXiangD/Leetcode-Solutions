# 
- Method 1

    Just recursion.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
            if(!root) return nullptr;
            TreeNode* tmp = invertTree(root->left);
            root->left = invertTree(root->right);
            root->right = tmp;
            return root;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
