# 1405. Longest Happy String

- Method 1

  Use a heap, and we add the longest possible char every time to achieve "balance".

  If we cannot add more chars, then return the current string.

  The code style is a bit messy, as I did this at a meeting yesterday and my leader was sitting next to me. But I still wanted to finish this problem, as a result, I can only write several lines when my leader was looking at another direction, and that was one of the worst coding experience I've ever got... Anyway, not a hard problem but there is some detail in it.

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        struct cmp {
            bool operator()(pair<int, char> a, pair<int, char> b) {
                return a.first < b.first;
            }
        };
        priority_queue<pair<int, char>, vector<pair<int, char>>, cmp> heap;
        string longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {

            if(a) heap.push({a, 'a'});
            if(b) heap.push({b, 'b'});
            if(c) heap.push({c, 'c'});
            string ans;
            char bef = '-';
            int time = 0;
            while(heap.size()) {
                auto t = heap.top(); heap.pop();
                if(t.second != bef) {
                    bef = t.second;
                    time = 1;
                    ans += t.second;
                    t.first--;
                }
                else {
                    if(time == 2) {
                        if(heap.size() == 0) return ans;
                        auto t1 = heap.top(); heap.pop();
                        bef = t1.second;
                        time = 1;
                        ans += t1.second;
                        t1.first--;
                        if(t1.first) heap.push(t1);
                    }
                    else {
                        time++;
                        t.first--;
                        ans += t.second;
                    }
                }

                if(t.first) heap.push(t);
            }
            return ans;
        }
    };
