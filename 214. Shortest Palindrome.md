# 214. Shortest Palindrome 
- Method 1

    Use kmp to find the longest common subfix of reversed s and prefix of s.

    The sad fact is that after 700+ lc problems, I still cannot memorize kmp... Everytime I do some kmp problem, I memorize it again quickly, then I forget it in less than a week. Then the next time I solve a leetcode problem again I still need to check my previous solution for kmp problems and repeat the above process. 

    The happy fact is that I am not even NG now, and I even had not come to America for my master program. I guess I will face interviews after at least half a year, and I think I can be treating hard problems like easy ones after such a long time.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        string shortestPalindrome(string s) {
            string rev = s;
            reverse(rev.begin(), rev.end());
            if(rev == s) return s;
            int n = s.length();
            vector<int> next(n);
            for(int i = 1, j = 0; i < n; i++) {
                while(j && s[j] != s[i]) j = next[j-1];
                if(s[i] == s[j]) j++;
                next[i] = j;
            }
            int m = rev.length();
            int longestPalLength = 0;
            for(int i = 1, j = 0; i < m; i++) {
                while(j && s[j] != rev[i]) j = next[j-1];
                if(s[j] == rev[i]) j++;
                if(i == m-1) longestPalLength = j;
            }
            rev += s.substr(longestPalLength);
            return rev;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
