# 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue  
- Method 1

    Use a monotonic stack. 

    However, we only count the ones that are visible, this is done by counting through pop number, as the invisible short ones have already been popped before when another man is seeing.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> canSeePersonsCount(vector<int>& heights) {
            int n = heights.size();
            vector<int> right(n);
            vector<int> ans(n);
            stack<int> s;
            for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
                int h = heights[i];
                while(s.size() && h > heights[s.top()]) {
                    s.pop();
                    ans[i]++;
                } 
                right[i] = s.size() ? s.top() : n;
                if(right[i] != n) ans[i]++;
                s.push(i);
            }
            // for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) right[i] = right[i] == n ? right[i] - i - 1 : right[i] - i;
            return ans;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
