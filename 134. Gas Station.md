# 134. Gas Station 
- Method 1

    Apparently we can just loop the whole array, starting from every index.

    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O($n^2$) | 


- Method 2

    Since the last method is so trival, we know that we want a better solution. 
    
    Actually, suppose we know there exists an answer (this can be easily judged by summing the array) , then we want to find the best point to start. So, the sum before the starting point should be the smallest, and also smaller than 0. So we just loop throught the array once.

    We return -1 if the loop value in the end is smaller than 0, meaning that there is no solution.

    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
            int minVal = INT_MAX;
            int curVal = 0;
            int minIndex = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
                curVal += gas[i] - cost[i];
                if(curVal < minVal && curVal < 0) {
                    minVal = curVal;
                    minIndex = i+1;
                }
            }
            if(curVal >= 0) return minIndex % gas.size();
            return -1;
        }
    };

    ```
