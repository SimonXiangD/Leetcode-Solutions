# 127. Word Ladder

- Method 1

  Use hash map to emulate graph edges and then do bfs.

  For each word, we replace one of its chars to \* and then add an edge from the changed to the origin.

  In the bfs, we find all its changes, and find in edges the one connect to its changes. We then do bfs for those new words. In this proess, we keep record of words we have processed and record their step number. So, quite typical bfs.

  Solution:

  ```h

    class Solution {
    public:
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> edges;
        unordered_map<string, int> rec;
        int ladderLength(string bg, string ed, vector<string>& wordList) {
            for(auto wd : wordList) {
                for(auto& c : wd) {
                    char tmp = c;
                    string cpy = wd;
                    c = '*';
                    edges[wd].push_back(cpy);
                    // edges[cpy].push_back(wd);
                    c = tmp;
                }
            }
            if(bg == ed) return 0;
            int step = 1;
            queue<string> q;
            q.push(bg);
            while(q.size()) {
                step++;
                int qs = q.size();
                for(int i = 0; i < qs; i++) {
                    auto cp_ori = q.front(); q.pop();
                    for(auto& c : cp_ori) {
                        char tmp = c;
                        c = '*';
                        for(auto t : edges[cp_ori]) {
                            if(t == ed) return step;
                            if(rec[t] == 0) {
                                rec[t] = step;
                                q.push(t);
                            }
                        }
                        c = tmp;
                    }

            return 0;
