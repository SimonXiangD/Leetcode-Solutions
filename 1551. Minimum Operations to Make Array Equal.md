# 1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal
- Method 1

    Divide into even and odd case. For even case, ans is $n^2/4$; for odd case, ans is $n^2/4$.

    For simplicity, write it into only one line.

    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(1) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int minOperations(int n) {
            return (n * n + 1) / 4;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
