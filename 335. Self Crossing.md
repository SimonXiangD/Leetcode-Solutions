# 335. Self Crossing  
- Method 1

    A really hard one... The proof is quite mathematical, and there are really a lot of cases to discuss.

    And eventually we have 3 cases to judge. Why only such 3 cases? I haven't found a good explanation written in English, but you can find a great answer on the Chinese version of leetcode app, written by leetcode official in Chinese. Quite funny! I only browse the app and do not do problems on the Chinese app, but the premium fee is cheaper in China(and you do not even need to pay money to see such good solutions), while I am paying a lot of premium fee on the English version of leetcode but cannnot see same good explanation.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(1) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        bool isSelfCrossing(vector<int>& distance) {
            int n = distance.size();
            auto& d = distance;
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if(i > 2) {
                    if(d[i] >= d[i-2] && d[i-1] <= d[i-3]) {
                        cout << 1 ;
                        return true;
                    } 
                }
                if(i > 3) {
                    if(d[i-1] == d[i-3] && (d[i] + d[i-4] >= d[i-2])){
                        cout << 2;
                    return true;}
                }
                if(i > 4) {
                    if(d[i-2] - d[i] > 0 && d[i-2] > d[i-4] && d[i-2] - d[i] <= d[i-4] && d[i-3] >= d[i-1] && d[i-3]-d[i-1] <= d[i-5]) return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.
