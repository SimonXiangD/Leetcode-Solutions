# 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game  
- Method 1

    Check [this passage](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/7048/a-recursive-formula-for-generalized-josephus-problem) for explanation.

    The memory is linear here, but we can change recursion to iteration to make memory constant.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h

    class Solution {
    public:
        int lp(int n, int k) {
            if(n == 1) return n-1;
            return (lp(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        }
        int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
            return lp(n, k) + 1;
        }
    };

    ```

<!-- - Method 2

    This is another method.

    | |   Complexity  |
    | ----------- | ----------- | 
    |  Memory     | O(n) | 
    |      Time       |  O(n) | 


    Solution:

    ``` h



    ```
